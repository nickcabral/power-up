      <p>Tips for using attachment-sections</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure your section feels at home on the card. It should fit in with the rest of the card and not stick out.</li>
        <li>You can specify a height when you claim the section, and also use t.sizeTo() to make sure your section is the perfect height.</li>
        <li>Try to keep the height of your sections to a minimum.</li>
        <li>It should be obvious to the user what attachments went into your section. They shouldn't be left wondering were one of their attachments disappeared to.</li>
